# CVE-2021-44228-playground

Running instructions:
- Make sure docker is installed and running
- Make sure docker-compose is installed
- Build the marshalsec .jar by running `mvn clean package -DskipTests` inside ./marshalsec
- Run ./build-images.sh
- Run `python3 -m virtualenv env`
- Run `source env/bin/activate`
- Run `python3 cli.py java8 $LOG4J_VERSION`

You need to run `cli.py` at least once to generate `poc_template/pom.xml` and `docker-compose.yaml` files, once that's done you can modify these two files manually and run `docker-compose up` to test the vulnerability manually.
